I am currently a Doctoral candidate at the Vascular Neurology and Rehabilitation Institute at the University Hospital of Zürich. Here, I am researching into dopaminergic modulation of motor learning mechanisms post-stroke, with the ultimate aim to improve stroke rehabilitation clinically. 
 
Prior to starting my PhD, I was researching potential Alzheimer's Disease therapies as a laboratory research scientist at the Francis Crick Institute, London, in close collaboration with UCL Drug Discovery Institute. There, I was involved in characterising the Wnt inhibitor Notum, as a means to delay the onset of AD. 
 
I joined the Crick after completing a Master's in Bioengineering. I am interested in neural circuit communication, thus during my Master's thesis, I researched sensorimotor circuitry, specifically focussing on the cerebellar involvement in adaptive behaviour. 
 
My interest in neuroscience stemmed from completing my BSc in Medical Sciences, where I focussed on the propagation of epileptic activity across the entorhinal cortex during my final year thesis project.
